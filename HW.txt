2. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) and JavaScript
Similarities:
Ubiquitous: They are both widely used programming languages in web development.

Web Page Functionality: They can both be embedded within HTML to add dynamic functionality to web pages.

Manipulate Data: They can retrieve or manipulate data through interacting with libraries.


Differences:
Server-side v.s Client-side: PHP (server-side language) runs on the web server and generates dynamic content before sending it to the coder's browser. 
On the other hand, JavaScript (client-side language) runs in the browser after the HTML has been loaded.

Execution: PHP code is executed using a web server with PHP installed, while JavaScript is executed 
within the web browser.


3. MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design structure commonly 
used in software development, especially in web applications. 
It helps to organize code into three interconnected parts,
each with its own responsibilities:
Model: affects what the user will see and manipulated by the controller
View: what the user sees based on the model
Controller: what is used by the user
